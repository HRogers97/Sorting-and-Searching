# Sorting and Searching

This program uses an array of string names and a corresponding array of integer weights. The program starts with a menu containing the following options:

## Shell Sort, Binary Sort, Selection sort

These options will all sort both arrays according to the name while also keeping the corresponding weights alligned with the proper name (e.g. if "Eric" with weight 140 starts in index 5 of the names array, then gets sorted into index 3, the weight will also be moved to index 3 of the weight array).

All of these use the sorting algorithms specified in the name, and all have been manually coded in without using external libraries.

## Binary Search

This option requires that a sort has already been done

This option will prompt the user to search for a name in the array. If the name is found, program will output that the name was found and what index of the name array it was in, as well as the corresponding weight for the name.
